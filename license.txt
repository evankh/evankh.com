<p>I chose this license to allow people to use and learn from my code. I know how frustrating it is to be learning a new technology and tearing my hair out looking for a solution to a problem I didn't even know you could have. I want the content on this site to be used as a reference for beginners and advanced programmers alike. With a permissive license, you can find the syntax you need or the one function you've been looking for, use it, and get back to solving the real problems.
<p>With all that said, the purpose of this site is to get me a job, so you can't use my code for commercial purposes. If you like what you see here and are interested in hiring me, please check out my <a href="resume.php">resume</a> to the left or <a href="contact.php">contact me</a>.
