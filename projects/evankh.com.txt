Website Design
PHP, HTML, CSS
<p>This is my own personal website, which you are browsing now. I created it with my own personal <a href="blog.php?date=2018-01-30&title=my-web-design-philosophy">design recommendations</a> in mind, and to suit my own personal tastes (which explains the eccentric color scheme). I used modern, up-to-date HTML5/CSS3 and designed it with both mobile and desktop browsers in mind.
